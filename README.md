# Incorrect Usage of $inc Operator in MongoDB Update Operation

This example demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations.  The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, providing a string value instead of a number results in an unexpected outcome and potential errors.

The bug showcases an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator where a string ("1") is used instead of a number (1).  This results in the `count` field not being incremented correctly or potentially throwing an error, depending on the MongoDB version and settings. The solution demonstrates the correct usage using a numeric value.
